🪞 Porcelain vs 🧰 Plumbing in Git
Category	Porcelain Commands	Plumbing Commands
Level	High-level (user-friendly)	Low-level (internal, script-friendly)
Audience	End users	Tools, scripts, Git internals
Output	Readable, formatted	Raw, structured (for parsing)
Stability	Stable, meant for users	May change, not always user-friendly

🪞 Git Porcelain Commands (high-level user tools)
These are what you typically use on a daily basis:

git init

git clone

git add

git commit

git status

git push

git pull

git checkout

git branch

git merge

git log

git diff

git reset

git stash

🧰 Git Plumbing Commands (low-level tools)
These are used by Git internally or in scripts for fine-grained control:

git hash-object

git cat-file

git rev-parse

git update-index

git write-tree

git read-tree

git commit-tree

git unpack-objects

git ls-tree

git for-each-ref

git show-ref

git update-ref

git check-ref-format

🧠 Tip to Remember
Porcelain = Pretty (what users interact with)

Plumbing = Pipes (what Git is built on)

Plumbing = Pipes (what Git is built on)

Let me know if you want to see examples of how plumbing commands work under the hood (like building a commit manually).

Here’s a comprehensive list of Git porcelain commands — these are the high-level, user-facing commands meant for daily use. They're designed to be human-friendly and stable.

🪞 Git Porcelain Commands (User Commands)
📁 Repository Setup & Configuration
git init — Create a new Git repository

git clone — Clone an existing repository

git config — Configure user settings

🔄 Working with Changes
git status — Show the working directory and staging area status

git add — Add files to the staging area

git restore — Restore files in the working directory

git rm — Remove files from working directory and staging area

git mv — Move or rename a file

🧱 Committing Changes
git commit — Record changes to the repository

git reset — Undo commits or reset the staging area

git revert — Create a new commit that undoes previous changes

🌿 Branching and Merging
git branch — List, create, or delete branches

git checkout — Switch branches or restore files (older usage)

git switch — Modern way to switch branches

git merge — Join two or more development histories

git rebase — Reapply commits on top of another base tip

📤 Sharing and Updating
git fetch — Download objects and refs from another repo

git pull — Fetch and integrate changes

git push — Upload local changes to a remote repo

git remote — Manage remote repositories

🔍 Inspecting History and Changes
git log — Show commit logs

git show — Show various types of objects (e.g., commits)

git diff — Show changes between commits, working directory, etc.

🧰 Temporary Changes
git stash — Save and restore uncommitted changes

git clean — Remove untracked files from the working directory

🧠 Notes
These commands are user-facing and are considered stable.

They often have simpler, cleaner outputs compared to plumbing commands.
